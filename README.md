# News App

A modern, responsive News Application built using React to display the latest news articles from various sources.

## Features

- Fetch and display news articles from an external API (e.g., NewsAPI.org).
- Category-wise news filtering (e.g., sports, technology, business, entertainment).
- Search functionality to find articles based on keywords.
- Pagination support for easy browsing of news articles.
- Responsive design for seamless usage across devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS or a UI framework like Material-UI/Bootstrap
- **API**: NewsAPI (or any other news API)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- API key from NewsAPI (or equivalent news service provider).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-app.git
   cd news-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the application for production.
- `npm test`: Run the test suite.

## API Integration

This application fetches news articles using the `NewsAPI`. Update the `API_BASE_URL` and use your API key in the `.env` file to integrate the API.

Example API Service (services/newsService.js):
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const API_BASE_URL = 'https://newsapi.org/v2';
const API_KEY = process.env.REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY;

export const fetchNews = async (category = 'general', page = 1) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}/top-headlines`, {
    params: {
      category,
      apiKey: API_KEY,
      page,
    },
  });
  return response.data;
};
```
